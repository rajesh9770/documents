============
copy 100-200 lines into another file.
:100,200w filename

===========
Write a part of file to another file:
Put cursor on first line of the group of lines you want to write out. Hit V, for "start visual block of lines".

Move cursor to the bottom of the group of lines. Vim will highlight with reverse video each line.

Write out. Hit : to go into command line mode. That will give you a prompt at the bottom of the scren that looks like: :'<,'> That means from the start of the visual block to the end. Type w and the filename and hit return.
===========

Do Search/Replace within a part of file.
Select the text in visual mode (I assume that's what you're doing), then press : to start typing a command, you'll see something like this appear in the command line:

:'<,'>
That means that the command will apply to the selection. Then type s/search/replace/ and hit enter. (Add a g after the third slash if you want to replace all matches, and a c if you want a confirmation for every replace)
